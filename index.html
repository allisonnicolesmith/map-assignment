      <h2>This year has been one of the deadliest years on record for hate violence against transgender and gender-nonconforming people in the United States.</h2>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.allisonnicolesmith.com/">Allison Nicole Smith</a> | December 11, 2020</p>
      <p class="content">Content warning: This article includes details of anti-trans hate violence.</p>
      <p>At least <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2020">41 transgender and gender nonconforming people</a> have been killed this year, more than any other year on record.</p>

      <p>Geography appears to play a role. Of the victims, 50% were killed in the Southern U.S., while 26% of the murders took place in the Midwest, Northeast and West combined.</p>

      <p>“Violence stemming from a ‘culture of honor’ is rampant throughout the region,” said Dov Cohen, a cultural psychologist at the University of Illinois.</p>

      <p>In 1996, Cohen conducted an experiment <a href="http://mypages.valdosta.edu/mwhatley/7670/activity/honor.htm">to test if Southerners were more prone to violence.</a></p>

      <p>Subjects underwent a series of tests designed to challenge their masculinity: forced games of “chicken,” people bumping into them and colorful name-calling.</p>

      <p>Southerners were not only visibly angry, they were angrier on a chemical level, showing significantly higher levels of cortisol.</p>

      <p>“Factor in religion and poverty, it’s not surprising hate violence of this kind is more prevalent in the South,” said Cohen.</p>
